The To-Do / Home UI: remove the duplicate small to-do list from the sidebar. Instead, keep a single compact To-Do link in the sidebar that navigates to the Home page’s To-Do widget. On the Home page the To-Do widget should be a full-page view or expandable panel that shows all to-dos in one place; clicking a task opens the task detail/history. The small sidebar widget is not required because the Home page must contain the full, maximized To-Do view.
Task row / task card appearance: make the task box thinner and use a single, consistent row layout across the entire app (lists, recent tasks, edition task lists). Each task row should show only the most important fields: Task ID, Assigned Date (created_at), Brand Name, Task Category (one of: Profile, Article, Cover, COY Cover, COY, AD, Other), Company Name, Company URL, Deadline, and a short Comments preview. If Task Category = Other, show the free-text “Other category” value inline. The row should be click-able to open full task details and history.
Create Task form: the form used by Sales (and CXO when creating article/ad drafts) must include these inputs: Brand (dropdown), Edition (dropdown with “Other” option + free text), Task Category (dropdown with option “Other” that reveals an input field), Company Name, Company URL, Priority / Deadline (date), Comments, File uploads (multiple), and Assign To (user dropdown, optional). When Sales creates a task they must select edition or explicitly mark “No Edition / Exception” for rare cases. Uploaded files should be saved as versioned TaskFiles linked to the task.
Ordering: everywhere tasks are listed, most recent first (descending by created_at or last_modified when relevant). Recent tasks window and All Tasks table must sort by latest activity by default.
Open tasks definition & pickup rules: define Open clearly as tasks that are unassigned and not completed (i.e., status = Open). Tasks with status Assigned, In Progress, Review, or Completed are not Open. Any user in Editorial or Design may pick up an Open task — i.e., claim it which sets the task to Assigned and assigns the user, or directly to In Progress if desired. Picking up a task should create a TaskHistory entry with timestamp, user and new status.
Roles and permissions: create a Super Admin role who has full access to Sales, Editorial and Design functionality (create/edit/delete brands/editions, reassign tasks, view archived data, and override locks). Other roles remain: Sales, Editorial, Design, and CXO. Role based redirects should send users to their respective dashboards on login. Super Admin can view and restore any CXO article removed from CXO lists.
CXO Dashboard & Article flow: CXO users can create Ads (brand-wise) and upload Article drafts (edition-wise) using a specific upload form. The Article upload form must include: Brand (dropdown), Edition (dropdown with “Other” + text), Company Name, Contact Person Name, Contact Person Designation, Company URL, File uploads, Comments, and an Override Assign To option (checkbox + choose editor) for rare cases. By default, after CXO upload, the article task should be routed to the Editorial To-Do list as an Open/Assigned task (default assigned to a queue or unassigned so editors pick it up) unless override was used.
Editor verification & approval: when an Editor opens an article task, they can download materials and verify whether the article belongs to the chosen Edition. There must be an Approve button for the Editor. If approved, the task moves to Design Open Tasks (unassigned pool) so any Designer can pick it up. If the Editor finds it is related to a different edition, the Editor must update the Edition dropdown (select another edition or choose Other + enter text). If the Editor marks Edition = Other, they must enter the suggested edition text; the task then returns to the CXO Articles pool with the Editor’s suggested edition and comment. CXO users can search and filter their article list and can re-open and reassign those tasks when that edition is later created.
CXO article lifecycle & exclusion after use: CXO article list should include filters (brand, suggested edition, status, date uploaded, used/not used). Once a magazine edition is launched (status changes to Launched/Printed/Online as per your edition lifecycle) any CXO article that is marked as Used for that edition must be removed from the CXO active list. Only Super Admin may view or restore these used articles from archive.
Statuses and state transitions: maintain a clear status state machine with explicit statuses such as Open (unassigned) → Assigned → In Progress → Review → Approved → Completed → Archived. Use consistent timestamps for every transition and create a TaskHistory record for each. Edition statuses remain: Scheduled, Ongoing, Hold, Canceled, Completed, Online, Printed, Shipped.
Task history, timestamps and archival discipline: every task must have an immutable TaskHistory log with entries for creation, assignments, status changes, file uploads/deletions, edition changes, approvals, and comments. Each history entry must record user id, action, old value, new value, and UTC timestamp. File uploads must be versioned and attached to history entries so the exact file set for each step is retrievable. Implement an archival policy where Completed/Shipped tasks remain readable indefinitely (archived but searchable) so that after 10 years the audit trail is crystal clear.
All lists and cards consistent UI: ensure the All Tasks table, Recent Tasks, Edition cards and All Magazines pages use the same row/card data mapping and consistent field ordering. Edition cards remain color coded by edition status and show number of tasks, plus quick filters to view only Open / Assigned / Completed tasks in that edition.
Database & schema notes (concise): add/ensure fields: tasks (id, title, brand_id, edition_id, category, category_other_text, company_name, company_url, created_by, assigned_to, status, priority_deadline, created_at, updated_at, completed_at), task_files (id, task_id, filename, version, uploaded_by, uploaded_at), task_history (id, task_id, user_id, action, old_value, new_value, timestamp), brands, editions (status, year), users (role, department), ads, cxo_articles (or use tasks with category=Article and source=CXO). Add indexes on created_at, updated_at, status and edition_id for fast queries.
Implementation checklist (developer friendly): 1) Remove sidebar to-do widget and route sidebar to full To-Do page; 2) Update Task model and Create Task form to include category “Other” + text; 3) Make single consistent task row UI and reuse component across views; 4) Implement Open status semantics and pickup endpoint that assigns a user and writes TaskHistory; 5) Add Editor Approve button and edition override flow that returns tasks to CXO with editor comments; 6) Add Super Admin role and full permissions; 7) Ensure all lists default to recent first and add server-side sort parameters; 8) Add immutable TaskHistory entries for every important event and versioned file storage; 9) Tests: create scenarios covering editor approve, edition change, CXO reassign flow, pickup flow and Super Admin overrides; 10) QA: verify lists, sorting, and that completed/used CXO articles are removed from active CXO listings and only visible to Super Admin.
