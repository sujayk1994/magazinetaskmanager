✅ PROJECT DESCRIPTION – MAGAZINE TASK MANAGEMENT APP (FLASK PROTOTYPE)

This project is a prototype task-management web app built using Python + Flask. It is designed for a magazine company that works with three departments:

Sales

Editorial

Design

Each department will have its own dashboard, but all dashboards will share the same overall layout.

🔵 Core Concept

The company manages multiple brands, and each brand contains multiple editions (monthly/yearly issues).
Brands and editions are created in advance, but the Sales Manager must also have the ability to create new brands and editions.

The system allows Sales → Editorial → Design → Sales workflow with full back-and-forth task movement.

🔵 Task Workflow
1. Task Creation (By Sales Department)

When a sales deal is closed, the Sales team creates a new task.

Every task must be associated with an Edition (selected from a dropdown).

For rare cases, include an option for “No Edition Assigned” (exception case).

Sales uploads the required reference materials (documents, images, audio, PDFs).

The task is then assigned to a member of the Editorial department.

Sales also sets an optional priority/target date.

2. Editorial Workflow

Editorial sees the task in their To-Do list with notifications.

After completing the content, Editorial:

Uploads output files.

Either sends it to Design for layout/design OR

Sends it back to Sales for client review.

3. Design Workflow

Design receives the task if Editorial chooses “Send to Design.”

After designing, they upload files and:

Send to Editorial for proofreading OR

Send back to Sales for client feedback.

4. Sales Feedback & Looping

Sales reviews client feedback.

They can reassign back to Editorial.

Editorial can send back to Design.

Design can send to Editorial again.

This loop can repeat any number of times.

5. Task Completion

Once the final material is approved, Sales marks the task as Completed.

Every action and file uploaded is stored in the Task History.

🔵 Task History

Each task has a dedicated history page containing:

Who created the task

Every status update (with timestamps)

All uploaded files at each step

Ability to download files

Comments and notes

🔵 Dashboard Structure

All three departments share the same dashboard layout:
